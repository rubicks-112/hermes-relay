"""Hermes-Relay server — unified WSS server embedded in the hermes-android plugin.

Exposes the chat, terminal, and bridge channels over a single WebSocket on
port 8767 (default). Replaces the standalone ``relay_server/`` package; the
top-level ``relay_server`` module is kept as a thin compat shim so existing
entrypoints like ``python -m relay_server`` keep working.

See ``plugin/relay/server.py`` for the aiohttp server,
``plugin/relay/channels/terminal.py`` for the PTY-backed terminal handler.

# Define __version__ *before* importing .server — server.py reads it back
# during its own import via ``from . import __version__``, so this ordering
# avoids a circular-import crash during package initialization.
#
# Canonical version source is `gradle/libs.versions.toml::appVersionName`.
# Keep this string + pyproject.toml's [project].version in sync with that
# every release bump. The /health endpoint reports this string, and shipping
# a stale version makes diagnosing "is the running process up to date?"
# harder than it should be (sample: spent two hours on Docker-Server
# 2026-04-12 because the running relay still reported 0.2.0 from this
# constant after a successful pull, while pyproject had drifted to 0.5.0
# ahead of any actual release and I bumped this to match that — both were
# wrong; 0.3.0 is the real in-progress target).
__version__ = "0.6.1"
